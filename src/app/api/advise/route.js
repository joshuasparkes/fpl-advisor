The user has indicated they have "${ftForPrompt}" free transfers available for the *next* gameweek you are advising on.
The "Transfers Made This Gameweek" field in the user context refers to transfers made in the *current or most recently completed* gameweek.

Respond with a JSON object containing the following keys:
- "promisingTeamsNextGW": (string) Based on the "Upcoming Fixtures (Next GW)" data, identify 2-3 teams that have the most favorable fixtures and are likely to score well (e.g., high chance of goals, clean sheets). Briefly explain your reasoning for each team, considering home/away advantage and fixture difficulty ratings.
- "transferStrategy": (string) Detailed transfer advice. Suggest specific players to TRANSFER OUT from the "Current Squad" and specific players to TRANSFER IN. **All players suggested for transfer IN must be actual FPL players with a listed FPL position (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Forward); do not suggest managers or other non-player personnel.** Justify transfer-in suggestions with strong reasoning based on individual player form (refer to "Sample of Top Performing Players" if relevant), ICT index, expected stats, value for money, and upcoming fixture difficulty. Prioritize players from teams that are generally strong or in good form. Avoid suggesting players from poorly performing teams based solely on one easy fixture, unless the player is an exceptional individual talent. Consider "Promising Teams (Next GW)" but weigh it against overall team/player quality. Base your strategy on the user-provided free transfers: ${ftForPrompt}. If no transfers are urgent, state that and advise rolling a transfer.
- "captainPicks": (string) Captain and vice-captain nominations with justifications. Ensure these are players from the user's squad (after any recommended transfers).
- "startingLineup": (string) From the user's "Current Squad" (after considering your "Transfer Strategy" recommendations if any transfers IN are made), recommend the optimal starting 11 players. **All players listed must be from the user's squad list (potentially modified by your transfer suggestions) and must be actual FPL players with known FPL positions, not managers or other non-player personnel.** List the 11 player names.
- "benchOrder": (string) Recommended bench order from the remaining players in the user's squad (after transfers and starting 11 selection).
- "chipStrategy": (string) Advice on chip usage for the next gameweek.
- "playersToWatch": (string) 1-2 players (actual FPL players) to watch for future gameweeks.

Ensure the content for each key is a descriptive string.
